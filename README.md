# Telemedicine-smart-Doctor

# It is the best way to treat the diseases before they attack

My lab has built a Cloud Virtual Smart Doctor (Dr. Cloud) with Alexa Skill, Recognition, AWS IoT and Lambda in serverless architecture. Dr. Cloud can talk to patient interactively with Alexa skill, analysis the patientâ€™s face with Rekognition, communicate to medical equipment through AWS IoT and use AR to provide visual instruction to the patient. The patient can do simple self-diagnostic at anytime and anywhere!
