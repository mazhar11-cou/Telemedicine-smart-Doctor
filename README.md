## Project Title: Telemedicine-smart-Doctor

## Project Short Description: 
Telemedicne Smart Doctor Diagonose a patient by Machine Learning services by AWS. It take Data from differnt madical organization and Store madical information. In serious condition targets to remind and refer patients to the real doctor. The real doctor diagnostic results can help the system learns and improves the diagnostic accuracy with AWS Machine Learning. It will save money time and strenth of a people. At last we say, Telemadicine Smart Doctor make the world more safe.

## It is the best way to treat the diseases before they attack

My lab has built a Telemedicine Smart Doctor (Dr. Cloud) with Alexa Skill, Recognition, AWS IoT and Lambda in serverless architecture. Dr. Cloud can talk to patient interactively with Alexa skill, analysis the patient’s face with Rekognition, communicate to medical equipment through AWS IoT and use AR to provide visual instruction to the patient. The patient can do simple self-diagnostic at anytime and anywhere!

## Alexa Telemedicine Smart Doctor Skill

This Alexa skill includes several workflows i.e. registration and diagnostic. The conversation is from a Medical School training script. The current response is not yet integration with AWS Machine Learning since we don’t have the suitable dataset in Bangladesh. 

By AWS IoT, it can control Web Cam and communication with the receiver. Data stored in DynamoDB, which includes medical record and patient information. It also sends subtitle and user demo video to AR Virtual Assistant.

## Overall Structure of Telemadicine Samrt Doctor

## Expalanation how to interect patient with Telemadicine Samrt Doctor

1. Patient interct with Telemedicine Smart Doctor by digital device like the Raspberry Pi, smart phone, tab, pad, pod etc.

2. Patient face decetion is completely based on environment, in the meanwhile we will use ML services like Amazon Recognition, Amazon Sazemaker etc. 

3. The vital sign is real time displayed in the dashboard (An alert will be showed and an email notification will be sent if there is any abnormal data)

4. The diagonose result will be stored Amazon RDS with the name of madical record. 

5. The patient will get the diagnosis immediately and if the patient has serious condition it will pass the ofline doctor by Amazon Alex.  


## Conclusion

The running cost of Dr. Cloud is very low cost and highly scalable (100% serverless). All conversations, data and diagnostic result are stored in Amazon RDS. In serious condition targets to remind and refer patients to the real doctor. The real doctor diagnostic results can help the system learns and improves the diagnostic accuracy with AWS Machine Learning. It will save money time and strenth of a people. At last we say, Telemadicine Smart Doctor make the world more safe.
